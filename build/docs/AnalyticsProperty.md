| **PropertyType** | **string** | Indicates what the data type is (e.g. integer vs string) and therefore how to evaluate what would constitute a match | |
| **Property** | **string** | User-defined rather than intrinsic system-observed values. These are tagged onto segments by other components within PureCloud or by API users directly.  This is the name of the user-defined property. | |
